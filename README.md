# praatVowelDymanicsExtractor
Loops over every .wav file in a folder and automatically measures formats for every labelled .textgrid segment at 5 equally-spaced spots.

This script now gets fomant measures at timepoints roughly equivelent to the 20, 35, 50, 65 and 80% provided by FAVE extract (http://fave.ling.upenn.edu/extractFormants.html). The column headings are also the same as automatically provided by FAVE extract, for parallelism.
